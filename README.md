# AI Planning: Comparison of Metric-FF and HTN Planners

Given the wide variety and number of planning domains, it is necessary to consider how 
problems in these domains might be solved most efficiently. I compared a domain 
independent planner, specifically Metric-FF, with Hierarchical Task Network (HTN) planners for two 
established domains: Blocksworld and Satellite. 

I developed HTN methods in GTPyhop to solve randomly generated problems in the Satellite domain. I conducted 100 experiments per domain to 
compare plannersâ€™ performance in terms of CPU time and plan length, finding that the HTN planner performed up to 100x better in terms of CPU time.

The [Report](Report.pdf) goes into further detail on how I structured my HTN methods for the Satellite domain, how I decided on Metric-FF,
and the design and results of my comparative analyses.

Navigate to [GTPyhop>Examples](GTPyhop/Examples) to see the HTN methods, experiments, randomly generated problems by size, and results for each domain. 

The [Metric_FF_and_Satellite_problems](Metric_FF_and_Satellite_problems.ipynb) notebook includes Metric-FF related work and experiments, and the generation of Satellite 
problems.

The [satellite-generator folder](satellite-generator) includes the code provided to me to generate Satellite problems.

Metric-FF results includes the results of running Metric-FF on each domain.
